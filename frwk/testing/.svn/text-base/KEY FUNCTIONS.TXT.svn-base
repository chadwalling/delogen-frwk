KEY FUNCTIONS FOR GETTING OBJECTFIELDS OBJECTVALUES 

1. function getFields(obj, field)
ex: select * from associations where object_id=3 and associationobjectlink2_id=2;
select * from objectfields where objectfield_id=(select object2_id from associations where object_id=3 and associationobjectlink2_id=2);

2. function getAssociationIdByObjValByObjField(objID, objectlink = 2)
select object2_id as association_id from associations where object_id in (select association_id from associations where object_id=3 and associationobjectlink2_id=2);


3.
select object2_id from associations where object_id in (select association_id from associations where object_id=3 and associationobjectlink2_id=2)


function getObjFieldValue(objectID, associationobjectlink2_id = objvalue(2), )
select object2_id from associations where associationobjectlink2_id=1 AND association_id=(select object2_id from associations where object_id in (select association_id from associations where object_id=3 and associationobjectlink2_id=2));

function getObjectValueByAssociationId(objId, assId)
//get objF -> assoc -> objValue
select objectvalue from objectvalues where objectvalue_id=(select object2_id from associations where associationobjectlink2_id=1 AND association_id=(select object2_id from associations where object_id in (select association_id from associations where object_id=3 and associationobjectlink2_id=2)));
